# Neural-Network-Matrix-Completion
This is a Tensorflow implementation of the paper "A Neural Net Framework for Accumulative Feature-based Matrix Completion". Please site the paper in your publications if you find the source code useful to your research.

# Installation
Install tensorflow.

# Model
The framework provides the completion of matrices with missing values. The entries of samples are assumed to be real valued. The framework introduces seperate neural network models for each feature column.  Update is performed on each iteration by using exploiting models after all models are trained. 

# Dataset
Benchmark dataset is Protein dataset which is provided beside the code.

# Training and Testing
